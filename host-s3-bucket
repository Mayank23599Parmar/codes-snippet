      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mvrc.fun/*"
    }
  ]
}
⚠️ Only use this if you're not using CloudFront OAC.

🔹 2. Create ACM Certificate
Required for HTTPS with your custom domain via CloudFront

2.1. Go to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
Region: ✅ us-east-1 (N. Virginia) – must be this region for CloudFront

Add domain names:

mvrc.fun

www.mvrc.fun

Validation method: DNS validation

Copy CNAME records shown

🔹 3. Configure Route 53
3.1. Add Hosted Zone (if not already)
Go to Route 53 > Hosted Zones

Create a Hosted Zone: mvrc.fun

3.2. Add DNS Records for Certificate Validation
Paste CNAME records (from ACM) into Route 53

Wait for ACM to show ✅ Issued

3.3. Update Domain Registrar
If domain was bought outside AWS, go to your registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)

Replace their nameservers with the ones shown in your Route 53 Hosted Zone

🔹 4. Create CloudFront Distribution
4.1. Go to CloudFront > Create Distribution
4.2. Origin Settings
Origin domain: Use the S3 Website endpoint
(e.g., mvrc.fun.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)

Origin Access Control (OAC): Optional if you use public S3 policy

Viewer protocol policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

4.4. Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)

www.mvrc.fun

4.5. SSL Certificate
Choose the ACM certificate issued for mvrc.fun and www.mvrc.fun in us-east-1

4.6. (Optional) Configure custom error pages, TTL, etc.
4.7. Create distribution and wait ~10 minutes for deployment
🔹 5. Configure Route 53 for CloudFront
5.1. Create Record for mvrc.fun
Record type: A

Alias: ✅ Yes

Alias Target: your CloudFront distribution

5.2. Create Record for www.mvrc.fun
Same as above

(Optional) point it to a separate CloudFront redirect, or to the same distribution as mvrc.fun

🔄 (Optional) Redirect www.mvrc.fun → mvrc.fun
If you want to redirect all traffic from www.mvrc.fun to mvrc.fun, create:

🔁 S3 Redirect Bucket:
Bucket name: www.mvrc.fun

Enable static website hosting (Redirect requests)

Target: mvrc.fun

Protocol: https

Set up a CloudFront distribution for this bucket
